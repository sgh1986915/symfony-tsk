GOALS: Weight Loss, Phys Cond, and Stress Relief
When I asked Dan why he was here he said to ç
"compete" has always wanted to compete...did some ç
Judo and KB yrs ago. He recently went to Rockland ç
BJJ but was turned off that a student was ç
teaching the class. Was very concerned that he ç
wouldn't be able to keep up with the class...in ç
fact once the orientation was over he said that ç
he was going to just watch the class and not take ç
it....I told him to take his shoes and socks off ç
because he signed up to do a class and class ç
started in a couple of minutes!
SR he did ok in class, had to take a bunch of ç
breaks, but pushes himself hard... told me same ç
thing wants to compete.  said he did a lot of ç
research about our organization and fighters... ç
recommended unlimited to him and went over sched, ç
said he needs to talk to wife, they have an ç
infant at home and wife will kill him without ç
discussing the money first.  said he could come ç
tomorrow at 7:45 and he will enroll, take ç
grappling and kickboxing after.

fine...had an mri done and it's only a sprain. He ç
won't be back until Fri because his cousin ç
