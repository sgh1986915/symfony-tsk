09/17/11 SR Tiffany did great in class... She is ç
pretty tall for her age.  mom is very nice, said ç
she used to train in the Nanuet mall.  Dad ç
recently died from Cancer, and she wants her to ç
do something to keep her focused, and something ç
that is positive. She only had $150 to put down ç
for down payment and will pay the rest next week.

04/02/12 MT talked to Sheila she said tiffany was ç
not in the mood to come anymore so she decided to ç
give her a break and see how she feels next ç
month. Said that march was the anniversary of her ç
dads death so she just needed time off.  She said ç
she was happy we called looking for her.
04/19/12 I spoke with Sheila she said that ç
Tiffany hasn't decided if she wants to continue ç
training....what? I asked why and she said that ç
Tiffany just isn't sure she likes this....I told ç
Sheila to bring her in and Sensei will have a ç
talk with  her but quitting shouldn't be an ç
option. Sheila said she will call Mond and to let ç
Sensei know when Tiffany will be in.
