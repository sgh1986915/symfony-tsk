10/10/13 SR Joey did great in class.  He is shy ç
but, it was his idea, he wants to do this and ç
parents were very excited and on board with it.  ç
He told me he wanted to know how to protect him ç
self from bullies. Parents said there hasn't been ç
anything major but he has said that some kids say ç
things verbally and he doesn't like it.  They ç
want him to build his self confidence and of ç
course learn self defense.  Dad is paying in ç
full, gave me cc, asked if I can run it after the ç
13th on his next cycle, will run in on Monday ç
14th.
