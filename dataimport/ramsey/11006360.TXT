GOALS:
1) Phys Cond.
2) Cardio
Claudia has trained in the Martial Arts for many ç
years. She has a black belt in Kempo which she ç
studied for 15 years. Before she came in she ç
wanted to make sure we didn't require students to ç
compete & do tournaments etc. Her old school made ç
them do competitions, she just wants to get a ç
great workout, and get back into training.
OUTCOME:
Claudia asked me about family plans last week b/c ç
she wants to train. She has 2nd pmt of $745 ç
scheduled to run on 25th so I went over UPG ç
options with her. She can't do full or 1/2 of ç
200, but said they could prob do the mid option ç
using the $745 as the DP. I wrote it all down for ç
her & she said she will go over w/husband.
