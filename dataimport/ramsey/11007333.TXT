03/06/13 SR Michelle came to me and said she ç
"needed to take a class", she went to the doctor ç
and was basically told she needed to do ç
something... she is going through some ç
depression, she doesn't like it here and thought ç
they would only be in USA for 1 year, now they ç
are staying longer and she didn't want to ç
originally, so she is trying to meet people and ç
have more of a social life and of course workout, ç
she needs to lose weight... jokes about herself ç
being overweight a lot.  
