08/27/07 CO INTRO:
GOALS:
1) Self- Confidence: Evan hasn't found a sport ç
that he likes so we're hoping this will be his ç
'sport'
2) Self-Discipline: Evan gives up pretty easily ç
at physical activities
3) Concentration: Evan can use help staying ç
focused
OUTCOME: Did well. He did 2 weeks of TKD while at ç
camp at the YMCA and seemed to remember a lot. He ç
is very hyper though. Scheduled ERT for 9/5 but ç
mom pointed out he will miss for Labor Day so it ç
will only be his 2nd class. Told her I'd speak ç
with her on the 10th and she can have til the ç
12th when he has class to decide.
