confidence.  she didn't really know what he would ç
get out of this, but he doesn't do anything else ç
now and she wants him to be active.  But, mostly ç
build his confidence.  He did great in class. Was ç
very focused for a 4 yr old.  She wanted to talk ç
to husband about money and we scheduled him to ç
come back with dad on Saturday 01/11.

gonna talk more with wife and call me later.
