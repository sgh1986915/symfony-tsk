class... I was very impressed with how mature she ç
was.  She is 18, came in by herself and told me ç
she wants to get a great workout, tired of the ç
gym, danced for years... after class she said she ç
loved it, wants to train 4x week... I went over ç
programs and she chose to do unlimited right off ç
