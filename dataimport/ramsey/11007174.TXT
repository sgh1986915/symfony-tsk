06/21/12 SR Sarah was a walk in, she told me at ç
the front that she needs to do something to get ç
into better shape.  When she came in today for ç
class, i saw that she has some limitations with ç
her elbows, arthritis and knees, knee surgery's ç
and she can't get up and down off the ground.  ç
Anyway, she teared up in the office, knows thatt ç
she needs this and signed up for 3x week.  Pat ç
weighed her and i will go over nutrition next ç
week.
