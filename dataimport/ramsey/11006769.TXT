GOALS: Stress Relief,Weight loss,Self Discipline.
Kristin is looking for a workout that keeps her ç
motivated, She works with a personal trainer now ç
but is not excited about her routine. She wants ç
to lose at least 30 pounds and isn't seeing it ç
come off.
SR did great, said she had done some kickboxing ç
before. she wanted to pay in full, but wasn't ç
sure about how much she had in account... she ç
didn't want to overdraft, so started with ç
payments and will let us know on Saturday to pay ç
off or not.
06/06/11 PW Kristin called to say that she wont ç
make it in on Wed as planned but will start back ç
on Sat.
