01/24/09 CO:
GOALS:
1) Balance/Coordination:
2) Physical Conditioning:
3) Flexibility:
Ariele has high muscle tone and needs therapy. I ç
hope that this will work and she will reach her ç
goals
OUTCOME:
Nira shadowed ariele for the class. She took her ç
off the mat during the game and when I asked what ç
was wrong she said she can't do this b/c she ç
won't listen and has tantrums. I told her she may ç
just need to get used to it, she said she'll talk ç
more on Mon after her class.

02/16/09 CO extended onto Trial and added to fam ç
plan. Removed the 8 trial classes and checked ç
into the Core classes she's already taken.
