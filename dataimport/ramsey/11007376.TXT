PROGRAM EXPIRES ON 12/26/13


2/9/11    
NO SHOW SWEEP/ Jeremy has been sick with a virus ç
and infection. Mom doesnt think he will be in ç
next week possiblly the following, tried to ç
schedule a scheduling conference. mdj

9/24/11  Jeremy's parents brought him in to take ç
class and have NEVER brought him to two classes ç
per week.  More so they only bring him once in a ç
while and have never taken the program seriously ç
for him.  I sat down with them and politely ç
explained that training less than two classes per ç
week is not an option, if they can't get him here ç
twice they should not bring him at all.  SENSEI

12/3/11  Jeremy's parents called and asked to ç
bring him in and speak to me after class.  They ç
want to bring him every Saturday and every other ç
week bring him Thursday.  Apparently weekdays is ç
too tough, I accepted their schedule and told him ç
he should not miss class.  SENSEI Q

12/10/11 BR will not be in today, will be in next ç
week on thursday to make up the class.
