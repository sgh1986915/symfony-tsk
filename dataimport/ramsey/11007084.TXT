03/29/12 SR Hannah is Harley Cho's friend... she ç
came with Harley and her mother for the class.  ç
she had to go speak to her mom about enrolling. ç
but she did a great job... she wants to lose ç
weight and be in good shape.  I will call ç
tomorrow to f/up
04/03/12 SR Hannah came in with mom, who doesn't ç
speak any english... she translated and signed up ç
for 2x week...

08/29/12 SR mom came in, she wants to cancel... ç
tried to tell her that she can't cancel just ç
because she is tired from school... mom through a ç
hissy fit yelling in Korean, said she didn't ç
understand what she was signing when she signed ç
up... Told her I think she understands a little ç
more English than she leads you to believe.  She ç
stormed out and left
09/01/12 SR sent certified letter saying she ç
wanted to cancel... it had nothing in the letter ç
except that she is too tired from school... 
09/05/12 SR autopay didn't go through... she ç
obviously cancelled her account.
