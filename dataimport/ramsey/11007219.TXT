08/25/12 SR William and Elizabeth did great! They ç
just moved here from the UK.. They did TKD, him ç
for 7years her for 5-6.  Parents are very cool. ç
Dad did TKD also and wants them to do this seeing ç
that it is much more practical.  Parents wanted ç
to talk it over with them before they jumped in ç
and signed them up. I told dad I would f/up with ç
them this week and try to have them back in on ç
Thursday.
