01/31/11 SR dad said he wants him to do this to ç
be more active... Luke dances, because it is a ç
family thing and he has no choice... but, dad ç
wants him to stay in even better shape and build ç
confidence...  Dad is very into the discipline ç
and is hard on him.
02/07/11 PW Luke's dad said he missed last week ç
one day due to the weather...he will make it up ç
either Tues or Sat this week.
On Excused List from 03/21/11 to 03/21/11
(PW sick)

4-21-11 BT ns spoke to the mom i asked if ç
everything was okay we havent seen luke in over a ç
month and the mom said i have no idea why my ç
husband signed him up so early because luke had a ç
crazy schedule untill may 1st, he had sports then ç
vacation and then missed a week of school due to ç
a  bad virus, luke will be back next week, she ç
also asked if he can make up all of those classes ç
and i told her that if she notified us a month ç
ago we could have froze his program but he was ç
just M.I.A. for a month and cant make up 4 weeks ç
worth of classes...

04/22/11 PW I sent an email re payoff
05/23/11 PW I spoke w/mom Luke's grandmother ç
