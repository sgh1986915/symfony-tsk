03/13/10 CO INTRO:
GOALS:
1) Self-Discipliine
2) Concentration/Attn Span
3) Balance/Coordination
Dylan is still young, would like him to learn the ç
above goals to help in all aspects of things he ç
does. 
OUTCOME:
Dylan did a great job, especially for only being ç
2 1/2. He has 3 older brothers & I think that ç
helps mature him a little bit. Even seemed a ç
little better behaved that his older bro who took ç
trial as well. Enrolled on 1x week, gave $50 off ç
2nd kid.
