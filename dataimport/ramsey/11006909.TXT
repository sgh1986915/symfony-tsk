GOALS: Physical Conditioning,Flexibility & Stress

Bill got a gift certificate 1/10 from his wife as ç
a Christmas gift and never used it....I told him ç
Sensei would give him 1 free class and training ç
gloves.
Bill works out 2 to 3x's a week on his own, plays ç
hockey,swims and goes to the gym. He is looking ç
to work on flexibility and physical conditioning.
He is concerned with sticking with a schedule.

SR he pulled a calf muscle in the class. but ç
finished and said he would need about a week ç
before he can continue to train.  He signed up fo ç
2x because he has a hectic work sched. will start ç
first week of OCT.
