01/31/13 SR Madison has a lot of energy... she ç
likes to talk a lot... parents want her to build ç
focus and confidence... mom runs a dance school, ç
so appreciated the things I talked about as far ç
as teaching philosophy... she wound up leaving ç
with 2 younger boys and I spoke to dad. he isn't ç
the boss, said he would have to talk to her... ç
later that night she called back, had a few ç
questions, but signed her up over the phone...
