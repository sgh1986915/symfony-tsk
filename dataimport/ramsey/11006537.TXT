05/24/11 PW Emily came in today to ask about ç
putting her program on hold...when I told her ç
that she still needs to make her monthly payments ç
she said that she is moving to Florida in August ç
and needs the money. She asked if she showed a ç
dr's note that she couldn't train would that get ç
her out of her payments?? I asked what was wrong ç
with her that she couldn't train? and was she ç
moving or sick? She said she just needs to get ç
out of the agreement...I told her to just get ç
back in and train...she said "uhmmm ok let me ç
see" then left.
