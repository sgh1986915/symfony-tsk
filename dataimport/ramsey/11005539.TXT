10/24/07 CO INTRO
GOALS:
1) Self-Confidence: Get Frankie to have ç
confidence to stick with something
2) Non-quitting Spirit: Listen better, not be ç
scared to try new things
3) Attention Span: Keep his attention span ç
growing.
OUTCOME:
Mom was concerned about him paying attention, and ç
what happens if he doesn't listen in class. I ç
told her he did great and we will work with him ç
to get him to pay attention and that is one of ç
the reasons she brought him here. ERT is 11/05 ç
