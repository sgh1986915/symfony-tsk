12/12/12 SR mom came to me and asked about ç
signing him up... dad never wanted to sign him up ç
because they say he quits everything... mom said ç
that her mom is paying for it... I ran dp and she ç
will give me mom's cc to either pay off or switch ç
for the autopay.
01/27/14 PW I spoke w/Liz and she said that Eddie ç
is not interested in coming back and she just ç
doesn't want to fight with him about it....Elise ç
is busy with volleyball and church activities. ç
She will bring Elise in this week and try to get ç
Eddie in as well. 
