04/18/13 SR Elijah is 4 but very smart for his ç
age... I told mom, we would try him out and see ç
if he was ready.  He did very well in the class ç
and followed everything! I told the mom I would ç
accept him and she was excited.  She wants him to ç
be more confident, she told me that he is ç
adopted.
