Mom said she mainly brought her here b/c Gianna ç

improve concentration/attn span also but said she ç
is still young.
OUTCOME:
Gianna couldn't stop talking about coming. Tried ç
a class at 'the little gym' but said she didn't ç
like it, wanted to do TSMMA instead. ERT 1/27, ç
exp 1/28.

01/28/09 SR spoke to Gianna's mom. she said she ç
wants to do it, its tough financially... she ç
asked if she could have one more day to decide ç
because she is a single mom and needs to talk to ç
her dad tonight and will know tomorrow... she ç
will call in the morning and talk to Cindy

01/29/09 SR mom called and signed up on 65 with ç
pmts over the phone.. she will be in on Sat 1/31 ç

agreements.... she said she would think about ç
training herself.. told her I would talk to her ç
about it next week and will follow up with her on ç
Feb. 17 about upgrade and pay off.

02/17/09 CO mom did UPG to 125, said she just ç
can't afford the extra 6 months for the 200 right ç
now. She needs to keep pmts under $300/month so ç
did a down pmt of $1000. She also said if she was ç
able to sell her condo she could do the 200 PIF ç
easily, just can't afford to know paying 2 ç
mortgages.

03/05/09 CO did PC w/mom. Said Gianna has been ç
asking about the grap especially. Mom was also ç
excited that she would actually have 2hrs in a ç

be until next month though...

04/28/09 CO followed up w/Celeste about poff ç
email. She said her closing was pushed back ç
another 10 to 14 days b/c of technical stuff, but ç
should be able to do it next month b/c she really ç
would like savings

05/02/09 CO followed up about PC, she said she ç

issues, but figures even if buyer has to back out ç
she will still get $3300 so is going to get gear ç
and she will grapple next Sat.

doing the 200 since the 300 would last nearly a ç
year & a half with the 100+ they still have. I ç

have to meet again in another 6 months. She said ç
she will make decision over weekend and meet Mon.
