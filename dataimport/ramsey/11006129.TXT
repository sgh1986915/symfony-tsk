Max is Julia Demenyeva's son. At first he ç
wouldn't do anything, he speaks both English and ç
Russian so gets confused w/laguages sometimes. ç
Enrolled in Cubs and told mom that we can credit ç
the 465 towards a family program when she signs ç
up.          
10/25/07 CO Max did a great job but was very ç
scared about class, didn't want to do anything ç
w/o mom. He is a good listener and should come ç
out of his shell.

go out on the mat...dad just took him home

know what he is going to do by the end of the ç
