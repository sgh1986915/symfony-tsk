17/2000 called for no show. a/m mom  Jennifer ç
came in and told me that she was having a medical ç
problem due to having just had the baby. Doc says ç
no karate, at least for now. She's upset and ç
jealous of her mom who gets to continue. She'd ç
begun to lose weight and feel good, and she wants ç
to come back. In the meantime she will continue ç
to pay for the program for Mitchell...(she spoke ç
to sensei or deshi about it.) and she's stuck out ç
in the "bleachers." mom
