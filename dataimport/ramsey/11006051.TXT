1-28-05 mb His mother came in today. She was ç
irrate because I yelled at Ali in class last ç
thurs. She also has a problem w/SQ because he ç
yelled at Ali a yr ago. She didnt like the way I ç
spoke to Ali in class. I had to stop the class ç
because he was bullying the smaller kids{as ç
usual} and not fighting against the bigger kids. ç
I told him if he didnt stop hitting his partner ç
so hard I would have to suspend him from KB for a ç
month. He did listen, but his partner didnt. I ç
gave his partner(morgan Edwards) the same speech. ç
I also gave them the option to beat the snot out ç
of each other; they didnt want to do that. His ç
mother didnt hear me telling Morgan to calm down, ç
I think she thought I was still yelling at Ali. ç
She didnt want to hear the Ali, her precious ç
baby, was a bully. She said that it was natual ç
for people to beat up on people that are weaker. ç
This is what makes him a bully.
