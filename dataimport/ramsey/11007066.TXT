03/14/12 SR Sandy is Andrew Mariani's mom.  I ç
invited her to train for parent appreciation, and ç
she decided to stick with it.  She started with ç
2x, because she says it's all she can afford. ç
Will prob upgrade in a month or two.

08/09/12 SR Sandy sent email last week that she ç
said to freeze her program and that the payments ç
were still taken out... she was bitchy to Pat ç
about all of it and demanded that money be put ç
back into her account. She came in today and ç
demanded the money back, I tried to explain thatt ç
the payments are for 12 consective months and ç
that the freeze time is added on at the end... ç
she was bitchy and called me names, said I had a ç
big ego and stormed out of here... said she will ç
be all over Yelp
Program Frozen from 07/02/12 to 08/31/12
