08/18/08 ja dad wants to do the month to help ç
faith with her training. pd 59 will start month ç
this week
2/19/09 SZ John keeps asking about how many ç
classes he has remaining.  Joshu went over all ç
the programs with him again  even the 800 class.
3/23/12 BR before John transfered to Paramus from ç
Wayne, while I was there, he didnt seem to ç
understand the concept of not being able to take ç
class anytime. He asked to take a class that was ç
full, and when I told him that he cant, he ç
threatened to call his lawyer. He then made a big ç
scene in the lobby and wouldnt go into the office ç
with sensei, and said he didnt trust him. At that ç
point, Sensei offered to cancel his program, give ç
him a refund, because he is no longer welcome in ç
Wayne. I witnessed this incident, I dont know how ç
or why he is now here, but he is a jerk.
