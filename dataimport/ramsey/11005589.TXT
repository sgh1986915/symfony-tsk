01/05/08 CO INTRO:
GOALS:
1) Self Confidence
2) Phys. Conditioning
3) Flexibility
Avery had been doing swimming for a long time, ç
but sprained her neck a few months ago and is ç
just getting back into activities. She isn't ç
really interested in swimming anymore so mom ç
wants her to be active and this is something ç
especially good for winter.
OUTCOME:
Converted Avery and Evan to fam plan and removed ç
8 classes. She had very good strength for her ç
age/size. Mom said husband may also be interested ç
in taking class so he may call to sched intro.
