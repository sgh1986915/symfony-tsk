06/20/12 SR parents brought him in to build ç
confidence.  he is a real nice kid, parents said ç
he is being bullied at school, dad seemed almost ç
desperate to do something by the fall, before he ç
has to go back to school. They loved the class, ç
and he did great. I put him on 2x and explained ç
about the upgrade, prob in month or two. 
10/01/12 SR went over 2/3 yr programs... dad will ç
let me know.
