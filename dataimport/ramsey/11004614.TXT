and his father's work sched cannot permit him to ç
get Michael here in addition to the "financial ç
hardships", etc.  I do know that he and his ç
brother drive and they could potentially get him ç
here.  I told him we are going to call him back ç

if they qualify for a cancellation.  He was ç
concerned about this months payment on the 20th.  ç
