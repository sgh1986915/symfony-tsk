04/02/12 MT talked to Marc's dad and he said that ç
he doesn't want to come anymore.  They said they ç
don't want to force him and they understand that ç
the program is a year and are gonna continue to ç
pay regardless but i told him that they should ç
bring marc in and sit him down with sensei to get ç
some motivation to get back into training again.  ç
He said he will talk to Marc and call us back.
