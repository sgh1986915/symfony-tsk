05/21/09 CO spoke to mom about Core. She said she ç
was thinking of giving her the summer off since ç
they go away alot and this is alot more expensive ç
than any of the other activities she does. Told ç
her this will be less $ per class, and we can get ç
her started now since they don't exp. I showed ç
her 65 and she said its just too much $ now and ç
maybe in the fall...

08/31/09 CO spoke to mom. Danielle knows Divya ç
Naraine from school so scheduled her to come in ç
to try Core tomorrow. She is still very concerned ç
about the cost, I reminded her she can make ç
monthly pmts. She will be here tomorrow and I ç
will go over it all with her then.

mom and she said her twins got sick so needs to ç
resched. Wants her to take her 1st class w/Divya ç
and said she can't make Fri so sched for next ç
Tues 9/8. She mentioned the $ again so I told her ç
let's just see how she does 1st and I will go ç
over everything in person in detail w/her, she ç
said OK.
09/08/09 CO mom called, not going to bring her ç
in. She said it's just too much $ to spend right ç
now and doesn't want her to take 1 class then ç
have to tell her she can't do it. She also said ç
2 days a week is going to be more of a commitment ç
than she can make right now... DONE
