01/28/14 SR "Yani" did very good. His dad trains ç
in Asylum, and said someone told him that our ç
kids program was excellent. He wants him to have ç
more focus and better self discipline. He wanted ç
to discuss it more with wife, they talked alone ç
in my office for a bit and couldn't make a ç
decision. Said he would call me tomorrow and let ç
me know, and prob bring him for next class on ç
Saturday.
