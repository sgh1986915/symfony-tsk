daughter to start but said she can only do 1 ç

this to be 'his thing'. She asked how long they ç
had til, told her next Thur so she will give me ç
final answer then.

01/14/10 CO had a looong talk w/mom about UPG. ç

being able to come 1x week until summer b/c she ç
has a diff activity every single day, also said ç
she is a "girly girl" and what if she doesn't ç
like it. Then asked what if Connor wants to quit. ç
I just reassured her that we won't let him quit & ç
classes don't exp so if daughter gets caught up ç
in other things can pick up wherever she left ç
off. She asked when she had til, told her 17th so ç
she is going to call by Sat to do it, just said ç
she wants to talk to husband & daughter to be ç
sure she wants to do it...
