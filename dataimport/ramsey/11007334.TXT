03/06/13 SR Jack did great in the trial class... ç
his parents brought him in because he was ç
diagnosed with ADHD... they also want him to ç
learn self defense, stand up for himself... and ç
to be fit, they don't want him to be soft on the ç
belly... they loved the class, signed him up for ç
2x and they will try a class too.
