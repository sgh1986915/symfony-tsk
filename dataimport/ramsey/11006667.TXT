GOALS: Tom wants Jack to get a good work out and ç
learn to defend himself. Jack was attending the ç
childrens program at LA Boxing but Tom felt that  ç
it was very unorganized and not a safe ç
environment. Tom said that the instructors were ç
kids themselves and pretty much let the students ç
get wild.
