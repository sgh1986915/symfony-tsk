12/30/09 CO mom brought boys for camp, said they ç
were both balling their eyes out this morning b/c ç
they didn't want to come... I said maybe they ç
were nervous about camp b/c don't know what to ç
expect, she said no, they do it every time they ç
have to come to class too. I suggested PL or ç
sensei speaking w/them to give a pep talk, also ç
getting close to yellow may get them excited; ç
since they were out they've been at blue for a ç
while (got hi blue's last Feb.)! She agreed, said ç
let's see how they do once they get new belts...
