03/17/12 SR Connor is a great kid.  has pretty ç
sever autism... parents said he did karate in a ç
place in hawthorne, which was a special needs ç
class with other autistic kids.  He did very good ç
in the class, Mike was with him the whole time.  ç
he talks a lot and is a little loud... so I took ç
him in the back during stretching.  Parents loved ç
it. I put him on an unlimited program, but he ç
will come 2x a week, one class and one pvt with ç
mike
