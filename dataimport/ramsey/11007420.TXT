10/02/13 SR Lisa was very nice, did great in the ç
class, her primary goal is weight loss and to be ç
in better shape.  she had gotten a Groupon that ç
espired on 09/27. I told her I would honor it and ç
gave her uniform, set up schedule... weighed her ç
for 90 day challenge and set up nutrition conf ç
for next week. I will then go over program with ç
her.  she seems very serious and would make a ç
great student.
