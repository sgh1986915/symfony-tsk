07/22/09 CO Dema came in to let us know she will ç
be leaving for Jordan on Mon so won't be in to ç
train for a while. Then she asked how pmts work ç
since they won't be training. Told her it will ç
run automatically. she was surprised, thought if ç
they didn't train they didn't get charged. She ç
asked what happens if they stop all together. I ç
said so you want to quit? she said no, but $ is ç
tight and Zo isn't working... told her we can't ç
stop the payments.
