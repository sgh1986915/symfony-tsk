10/20/10 SR Tyler is 17, went on the internet and ç
didn't sign up, Kelly sched him to come after ç
calling him... He said he wasn't allowed to do ç
Martial Arts when he was younger, because his ç
grades where no good, but now he is a senior and ç
is doing very well, so his parents said it would ç
be ok... he said he might want to do this a a ç
profession? His dad was supposed to come after ç
the class but didn't show... I wrote down the ç
price for Tyler to go over with his parents and ç
sched a 2nd class to come in on Friday 10/22.... ç
We shall see.
