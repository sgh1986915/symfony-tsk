12/23/10 PW Luke came in with his grandma and was ç
very excited to take the class. He did a really ç
good job of listening and waiting his turn..most ç
of the time! Grandma said that Suzanne will sign ç
him up when she comes in later with the Bryan and ç
Emma....Suzanne signed Luke up, got 40%discount ç
for the 3rd family member paid $279 for 15wk ç
program.
01/27/11 PW Suz came in with Bryan and Emma ç
forgot about cubs class today...told her ok to ç
bring him in on Sat.

03/29/11 PW lm call me re Luke and his program ç
(move to childrens class)
03/29/11 PW Suz called back I told her that I ç
thought Luke should move up to childrens ç
class...his focus and attention have improved and ç
he isn't gaining anything from cubs...he just ç
gets distracted with the equipment and games...I ç
think he would do much better in Sensei's class! ç
Suz isn't sure but will try it...he wont come to ç
cubs thurs but to the childrens class w/Bryan and ç
Emma.
