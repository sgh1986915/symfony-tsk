05/17/06 I spoke to brendan's mom about his test ç
and that he needed to work on some close range ç
defense,they are going to be going on vacation in ç
july for two weeks and would that affect their ç
chances of going to the black belt test I said we ç
would cross that when we get to it,she ok because ç
but if doesn't go he will take a break for a ç
while for football and to save their hours , I ç
said i wouldn't recommend them doing that because ç
that will set him back in the long run,she was ç
like well it is what it is(seemed like she wanted ç
to stretch the classes out because they didn't ç
want to buy more).ml
