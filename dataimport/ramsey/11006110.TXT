12/10/10 PW I spoke with Maria to see how Marcelo ç
did in the COC. She said that grappling was not ç
very good, he wasn't aggressive and didn't do ç
anything..kept looking at the points and the ç
ref's..She said kb was alittle better and that ç
she thought he could have won but the other kid ç
was just alittle more aggresive than he was. She ç
and her husband both discussed that maybe Marcelo ç
is just not aggressive enough for competition. I ç
told her that she needs to keep him competiting ç
so that he is confident enough to be aggressive  ç
when he needs to be. Her husband wants to come ç
and do classes too and maybe that will keep ç
Marcelo excited about training. She is picking up ç
a schedule tomorrow and will let me know when her ç
husband can come in for an intro.
