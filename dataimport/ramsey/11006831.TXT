Infinate MMA???  He is pretty good! Strong! Very ç
good Muay Thai, and said he did about 4 years of ç
JuJuitsu.  He wants to Fight and compete for ç
TSMMA.  He went to boarding school in ç
Switzerland.  I think his family is pretty ç
wealthy.  He is going to another school in Conn. ç
in the fall, but said he would still sign up ç
because he'll be here every week back and forth.  ç
