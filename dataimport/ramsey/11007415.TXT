09/30/13 PW Will's dad wants him to be more ç
confident and to be able to defend himself. After ç
class dad talked about the bus incident where ç
Will was slapped and picked on. Dad said that ç
Will never told his parents what happened and he ç
learned about it from neighbors kids. Dad doesnt ç
want his son to be a target and thinks this was ç
very good for him. Will came off the mat super ç
excited. Dad wants him to do this and will bring ç
him tomorrow for class just needs to run it by ç
the wife.
