07/27/09 CO spoke to Paula about grap and kbox. ç
She said she tried grap once and HATED it. She ç
doesn't want to kbox b/c she doesn't want to get ç
hit. I told her not to worry about that, that's ç
not what the class is all about. She is going on ç
vaca for a week so will talk again about it when ç
she gets back...
