11/3/11 SR Stu is Jessica Labosky's fiance.  He ç
watched her intro and decided he would try it ç
too, he loved it... Signed up for 3x and is ç
paying for both of them... He really needs to ç
lose weight and together they are motivating each ç
other to get in shape and be healthier.
His start weight is 284lbs.  I did nutrition with ç
him and they are both on the 90 day challenge.
