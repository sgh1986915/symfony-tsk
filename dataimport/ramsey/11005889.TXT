10/13/08 CO INTRO:
GOALS:
1) Self Confidence
2) Self Discipline
Iris needs to have better self confidence and ç
learn not to give up. Mom said Iris is very timid ç
and scared to try new things, if she doesn't do ç
well she just wants to give up.
OUTCOME:
Iris is a very good kid. I could tell she was ç
nervous but she got more comfortable as class ç
went on. She is not very coordinated, mom said ç
she gets PT in school, but that its not very good ç
in her opinion. ERT 10/24 exp 10/28  
10/17/08 CO spoke to mom about training herself, ç
she said she is interested but is very nervous. ç
She is going to sched her intro next Mon while ç
Iris is here for class. 

10/20/08 CO mom sched intro for Fri. She was ç
concerned about cost after month b/c she doesn't ç
want to like it and not be able to afford it. ç
Told her sensei will go over it all w/her on Fri. ç

02/07/09 CO did ER w/Nira. Told her if she wants ç
Ariele to continue she has to renew plan and is ç
at discount point anyway. She needs to figure out ç
things w/soon to be ex-husband b/c he won't pay ç
if he knows she is using classes also. Will speak ç
to him and let me know next Sat.

02/14/09 CO dad came w/Ariele for class, I called ç
Nira and she said to talk to him about ER. Seemed ç
like a pretty nice guy. Was concerned about pmts ç
b/c he's still paying over $400/month. Told him ç
montly pmts will actually be less. Did 1st ç
option, didn't want to sched f/up for poff, just ç
got laid off, said he will let us know if he can ç
do it...

is going to get her gear. Had to wait for check ç
from ex-husband so she had the $... 

03/11/09 CO spoke to Nira about UPG. She really ç
wants to do it, but can't let husband know. Told ç
her pmts will be close to the same. She is going ç
to see if she can do the DP so he doesn't see ç
that on card or ask if he will pay some of it. ç
For some reason it doesn't show upgrade options ç
so wrote down what it would be and she will let ç
me know Mon. 

03/16/09 CO followed up w/Nira about UPG. She ç
didn't speak to husband about it yet, afraid to ç
ask him. she is going to check her account to see ç
if she has the $676 to put down. Will know Thurs ç
when she's in for class. 

03/25/09 CO ordered gear for Iris w/Nira. Needs ç
to go over sched before choosing days. Also ç
followed up about UPG w/her, see Nira's F5...

She said she only has sitter til 5:30 so doesn't ç
want to drag younger ones out to pick her up at 6 ç
b/c they will throw a tantrum. I told her that ç
sounded a little silly to me, holding her back ç
for that...she said she will try for Sat class or ç
