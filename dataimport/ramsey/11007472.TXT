01/28/14 SR Emma did awesome in the class. She is ç
a little immature. Doesn't really listen when you ç
are talking to her.  Mom said she has been ç
bullied especially by boys. She has an ç
alternative look. Colored hair, kind of goth even ç
at 12.  Mom wants her to build self confidence, ç
said she goes to a therapist, has been cutting ç
herself. Therapist said this is just what she ç
needs. Mom loved it and pif.
02/05/14 SR got a weird msg on my phone that mom ç
said she wasn't coming back???
