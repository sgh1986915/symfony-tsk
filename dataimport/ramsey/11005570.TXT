03/19/08 AM PL with Chris went extremely well.  ç
He was attentive and focused.  His jab and cross ç
look alot tighter and there is less extraneous ç
movements.  His fists are hitting the targets in ç
the correct way with the flat side of the fist ç
hitting not the front or back of the hand like ç
before.  Note when he is motivated and pushed he ç
excells.  Alot of his motor movements are still ç
uneven and his mother recommended situps, some ç
jogging (to correct his gate), and other core ç
strengthening exercises to help his muscle ç
imbalances.  Progress is being made.
