02/25/14 SR Both parents said they wanted him to ç
have better focus and discipline...Also better ç
posture, he slouches a lot.  He did great in the ç
class, had great focus and tried hard. They ç
wanted to discuss it more at home and go over the ç
other things he is doing in schedule.  They moved ç
here about a month ago from California. I will ç
call them on Thursday if I don't hear from them ç
sooner.          
