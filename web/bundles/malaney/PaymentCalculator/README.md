== Payment Calculator ==

The Payment Calculator javascript library is designed to compute payments toward a principal based on a number of payments.  It will be used in an application where end-users will help customers to determine a payment plan for a given balance.  Ideally, the library itself should use pure javascript, with as few external dependencies as possible. I would also like to use some sort of a testing framework such as Jasmine https://github.com/pivotal/jasmine for this.  Please take a look at http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/javascript-ajax/testing-your-javascript-with-jasmine/ for examples on how to test.

Main script is src/payments.js

Run SpecRunner.html in browser to run tests
